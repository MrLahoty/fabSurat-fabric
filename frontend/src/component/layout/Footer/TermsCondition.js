      <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
      <p>
      Please read the following terms and conditions very carefully as your use of service is
subject to your acceptance of and compliance with the following terms and conditions
("Terms").
      </p>
      <p>
      In these Terms, references to "you", "User" shall mean the end user accessing the Website,
its contents and using the Services offered through the Website. <strong>"Service Providers"</strong> mean
independent third party service providers, and "we", "us" and "our" shall mean “FABSURAT”.
You agree that you are only authorized to visit, view and to retain a copy of sections/pages
of the FABSURAT website for your own personal use, and that you shall not duplicate,
download, publish, modify, hack, tamper with, damage the contents in any manner or
otherwise distribute the information, data, software, photographs, videos, typefaces,
graphics, music, sounds, and other material on the  <strong>FABSURAT website</strong> (collectively
"Content") for any purpose other than to review product and promotional information, or to
purchase product for your personal use, unless otherwise specifically authorized by
<strong>FABSURAT</strong> to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
      We <strong>FABSURAT</strong> reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any
reason. Some situations that may result in your order being cancelled include limitations on
quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information, or
problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may also require
additional verifications or information before accepting any order. We will contact you if all or
any portion of your order is cancelled or if additional information is required to accept your
order. If your order is cancelled after you have made payment for the same, the said amount
will be reversed back to the same account from which payment was made.
Any decision taken by us in respect of cancellation of an order shall be final and binding on
you. You hereby agree to not dispute the decision made by us and accept the decision
regarding such cancellation.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>FABSURAT</strong> reserves the right at all times to discontinue or modify any of our T&C and/or our
Privacy Policy as we gauge necessary or desirable without prior notification to you. Such
changes may include, among other things, the adding of certain fees or charges. We
suggest to you, therefore, that you re-read this important notice containing our T&C and
Privacy Policy from time to time in order that you stay informed as to any such changes. If
we make changes to our T&C and Privacy Policy and you continue to use the site, you are
implicitly agreeing to the T&C and Privacy Policy expressed therein.
The subtle variations in color, texture and finish are intrinsic to the fabrics and materials.
An irregular weave or print or design is not a defect, by definition means uncertainty when it
comes to uniformity.
      </p>
      <p>
      We have done our best to display as accurately as possible the colors of the products shown
on this web site. However, because the colors you see will depend on your monitor, we
cannot guarantee that your monitor display of any color will be accurate.
Dark colors tend to run. It is highly recommended to dry clean every product. Pure Fabric
must only be dry cleaned.
